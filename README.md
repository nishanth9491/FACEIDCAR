## Background

In today's world, car theft is a genuine concern for vehicle owners. Combining Raspberry Pi with GPS technology offers an innovative approach to boost vehicle security. The GPS module not only improves preventive measures but also facilitates recovery by tracking the vehicle's location in real-time.

## Problem Definition

Traditional vehicle security systems often lack real-time alerts and effective recovery solutions, leaving owners vulnerable to theft. There is a need for a comprehensive anti-theft solution that combines prevention and recovery.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:
1. **Enhanced Security:** Develop an advanced anti-theft system.
2. **Real-Time Alerts:** Implement a mechanism for prompt notifications.
3. **Vehicle Tracking:** Utilize GPS technology for real-time tracking.
4. **Integrated Surveillance:** Combine sensors and cameras for enhanced monitoring.
5. **User-Friendly Interface:** Create an interface for easy system monitoring and control.

## Existing System

Traditional vehicle security systems rely on physical locks, alarms, and key-based mechanisms. However, they often lack real-time alerts and tracking capabilities, resulting in insufficient security coverage.

## Proposed System

The proposed system overcomes these limitations by leveraging Raspberry Pi's computational power and a GPS module. It combines sensors, cameras, and real-time alerts for a comprehensive security solution.
